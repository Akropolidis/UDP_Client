Windows Forms App project to read Gpio pins on Raspberry Pi and send Network Packets via the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) network communication. This was done using Winsock programming. The UDP loopback program sends the packet composed of a sequence of 6 bytes, that are encoded with the required settings based on the realtime statuses of the flexdio pins.
